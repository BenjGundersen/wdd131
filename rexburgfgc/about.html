            <p>Welcome to the Rexburg Fighting Game Community website. Here you will find recorded gameplay, details about those videos, how to contact us, and more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Rexburg FGC started as an off-shoot of the ever popular, Rexburg Smash Bros community. Spearheaded by BakerFalcon, Nervous, and others; the Rexburg FGC has gone from a relatively tiny community, to a small, yet tight community of gamers. Our numbers have only grown over the past few semesters. We hope that by archiving our gameplay footage, we can inspire others to join us, and in the future, continue our legacy.</p>
